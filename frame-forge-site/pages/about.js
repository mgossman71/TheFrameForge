      <p>
        At The Frame Forge, we pride ourselves on being a family-run business
        where passion meets precision. With over 30 years of experience in custom
        PC building and enterprise compute infrastructure, I bring expertise and
        dedication to every project. My journey began in the mid-90s, shaping my
        understanding of technology and its ever-evolving landscape.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Now, I am thrilled to share this journey with my son, who has developed a
        keen interest in gaming and the systems that power it. While he is still
        learning under my guidance, together we are building a legacy of
        craftsmanship and innovation. Our collaboration ensures that every PC we
        create not only meets but exceeds expectations, blending cutting-edge
        technology with personal style.

        At The Frame Forge, it&apos;s not just about building machinesâ€”it&apos;s about
        crafting experiences. We invite you to join us in creating something
        extraordinary, built hand-in-hand by a father and son dedicated to
        excellence.
